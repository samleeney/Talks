# Abstract

In this talk we propose a first of its kind RFI mitigation algorithm that takes a Bayesian Approach, where contaminated data is
both flagged and managed as part of a single step fitting process. We provide an analytical proof of our methods, which are also
tested and shown to be effective on both a simple toy model and when incorporated into the Bayesian data analysis pipeline for
REACH, a modern radio telescop
