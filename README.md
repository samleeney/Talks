# Abstract
This talk presents a fast, marginalised Bayesian approach to searching for dispersed radio transients directly in raw time–frequency data. We contrast classical dedispersion/SN pipelines with a fully probabilistic model that jointly fits the signal and flags radio-frequency interference instead of compressing or masking first. By choosing physics-informed priors (DM, width, arrival window) and analytically marginalising amplitude, noise, and anomaly masks, we reduce Bayes factor evaluation from minutes to tens of milliseconds while keeping the computation parallelisable on GPUs. A Laplace approximation over the remaining track parameters closes the loop, enabling calibrated evidence scores for FRBs, pulsars, and other dispersed pulses even in heavily contaminated data. Real data demos and synthetic sweeps illustrate the gains and the remaining challenges.
