# Abstract
Interfering signals such as Radio Frequency Interference from ubiquitous satellite constellations are becoming an endemic problem in fields involving physical observations of the electromagnetic spectrum. To address this we propose a novel data cleaning methodology. Contamination is simultaneously flagged and managed at the likelihood level. It is modeled in a Bayesian fashion through a piecewise likelihood that is constrained by a Bernoulli prior distribution.
